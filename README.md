# Pythonizer
Ever wanted to use python but were stuck writing code in Java? Now you can have the best of both worlds!

How to use:

```./pythonizer <java_file_name.java>```

Example change: (sample from https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples/blob/master/bigquery/cloud-client/src/main/java/com/example/bigquery/QuickstartSample.java)

```./pythonizer sample_java.java```

Made use of https://github.com/google/google-java-format for standardising the formatting!
