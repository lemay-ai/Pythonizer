# Pythonizer
Formats code into looking much more fabulous

Stuff that's needed!
- first run code to convert to google standard so that input is predictable
- all those gross semicolons and brackets should be aligned on the far right
- Python style comments- multi-line comments?
- Additional languages- automatically detect which language used if possible
